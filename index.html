      <h3>A Brief History of the SAAB 99 Turbo</h3>
      <p>
        In 1978 a turbocharged version of the car, the 99 Turbo, was introduced. It was only available as a combi coupé until the next year. The turbocharged two-liter engine produced 145 PS (107 kW; 143 hp) giving the car top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph). The turbochargers were designed and built by Garrett AiResearch. In terms of appearance, it received distinct alloy wheels and front and rear spoilers.[13] This car repositioned Saab globally and the 99 Turbo gained a reputation as one of the most iconic and technology changing cars of the century. By early 1979, over 10,000 turbo-engined Saabs had already been built, as Saab successfully entered a new market segment.

        Introduced in 1978. It was fitted with a turbocharged version of the 2-litre             engine. The body was originally a 3-door combi coupé version but later in 1979-80 the   company produced a two-door model, which was a limited homologation exercise to  enable the production of a rally car. It was available in Cardinal red, Sterling silver, Anthracite grey, and Black; the two-door was available in metallic green. The Turbo S was a special model with factory-mounted water injection, giving an extra 15–20 PS. In 1978 there was a very limited edition of a little over 100 five-door 99 Turbos. They were only available in Cardinal red.
